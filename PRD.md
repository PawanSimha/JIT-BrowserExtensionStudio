# Product Requirements Document — JIT Browser Extension Studio

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Project Name** | JIT — Browser Extension Studio |
| **Target Release** | Q2 2026 |
| **Status** | Active Development |
| **Author** | Pawan Simha R |
| **Repository** | [github.com/PawanSimha/JIT](https://github.com/PawanSimha/JIT) |

## 1. Executive Summary

JIT is a small studio that builds clean, focused browser extensions and a brand website to showcase them. The product consists of five Chrome extensions — **MutedHue** (adaptive text-selection color replacement), **Refreshner** (smart auto-refresh with keyword page monitoring), **Goofanizer** (responsive device switcher with screenshot/export), **Imageination** (page media scanner and batch downloader), and **StackLens** (website tech stack detector) — plus a dark-themed marketing site with a developer portfolio, FAQ, and contact gateway. We are building this to prove that browser extensions can be minimal, privacy-respecting, and beautifully integrated into the user's daily workflow.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

**Pain Point:** Browser extensions today are often bloated, privacy-invasive, visually jarring, or abandoned. Users face three specific frictions:

1. **Visual fatigue** — The default blue text-selection highlight clashes with many site themes and is especially jarring in dark mode.
2. **Inefficient page monitoring** — Users who need to watch pages for content changes resort to manual refreshing, unreliable tools, or extensions with excessive permissions.
3. **Distrust of extensions** — Most extensions request broad permissions, phone home with analytics, or bundle trackers.

**JIT's solution** is a set of extensions that each do one thing exceptionally well with zero data collection, paired with a transparent brand site that communicates values clearly.

## 3. Target Personas

| Persona | Role | Needs | Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Visual Comfort Seeker** | General web user / Designer | Wants a consistent, eye-friendly text-selection experience across all sites | Installs MutedHue and forgets about it — the extension works silently on every page |
| **Productivity User** | Developer / QA / Shopper | Needs to auto-refresh pages and get notified when specific content appears or disappears | Configures Refreshner intervals and keywords, leaves browser running in background |
| **Privacy-Conscious Adopter** | Power user / Open source advocate | Seeks tools that are transparent, auditable, and collect zero data | Reads the FAQ, inspects the source on GitHub, contributes issues/PRs |
| **Responsive Developer / QA** | Web developer / QA engineer | Needs to test layouts across device sizes, capture screenshots for documentation | Uses Goofanizer presets, rotates viewports, exports batches of responsive screenshots |
| **Media Collector** | Designer / Content creator / Researcher | Needs to batch-download images, video, and audio from web pages without digging through the DOM | Opens Imageination popup on any page, browses categorized media, downloads individually or batch as ZIP |
| **Tech Stack Explorer** | Developer / Researcher | Wants to understand what technologies power any website they visit, with explanations and visual diagrams | Opens StackLens popup on each site, browses categorized tech list, explores architecture and security analysis |

### P1 — Should Have (high priority, not yet complete)

| Feature | Rationale |
|---|---|
| **Chrome Web Store publishing** | All five extensions are fully coded but not yet submitted to CWS |
| **Privacy Policy / Terms of Service pages** | Footer links currently point to PRIVACY.md placeholders — needed before CWS submission |
| **Thank-you / redirect page after form submission** | Currently button just shows "Sending…" with no success confirmation |
| **Firefox (WebExtension) port** | MutedHue CSS-only port is trivial; Refreshner needs `browser.alarms` & `browser.notifications` adaptation. Goofanizer cannot be ported — `chrome.debugger` is Chromium-only. StackLens also excluded — uses Chrome-specific `webRequest` |

### P2 — Could Have (logical future enhancements)

| Feature | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Opt-in usage analytics dashboard | Helps developers understand which features are used most |
| Extension update notification on website | Display latest version / changelog on `extension.html` |
| Dark/light mode toggle on website | Currently follows OS preference via CSS custom properties (partially implemented) |
| i18n / multi-language FAQ | Broaden reach to non-English users |
| Automated CI tests for extensions | Run lint + validation on PRs to `MutedHue/`, `Refreshner/`, and `Stacklens/` (WXT vitest) |

---

## 6. Technical Constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Chrome MV3 only** | All extensions target Manifest V3. Service workers replace background pages. No `webRequest` blocking — Refreshner uses `alarms` + `tabs.reload`. |
| **Zero external network calls from extensions** | MutedHue requests **zero permissions**. Refreshner only uses `storage`, `alarms`, `notifications`, `tabs`. Goofanizer uses `debugger`, `storage`, `tabs`, `activeTab`, `downloads`, `windows`. Imageination uses `activeTab`, `downloads`, and `<all_urls>` host permissions. StackLens uses `storage`, `activeTab`, `webRequest`, `tabs`, and `<all_urls>` host permissions — all local detection via DOM scanning + header analysis, no analytics, no telemetry. |
| **Chrome Debugger API (Goofanizer)** | Goofanizer uses `chrome.debugger` to attach to tabs and send `Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`. This is Chrome-specific and will not work in Firefox or non-Chromium browsers. Screenshots use `Page.captureScreenshot`. |
| **Browser storage for Refreshner state** | `chrome.storage.local` — limited to ~10 MB per extension. State keyed by `tabId`. |
| **Form submission via third-party** | `formsubmit.co` handles email forwarding. No custom backend. Form data leaves the browser to an external service. |
| **No build step** | Pure static HTML/CSS/JS. No npm, no bundler, no transpilation. Google Sans fonts loaded via CDN `@font-face` from `fonts.gstatic.com`. |
| **Web Audio API for alerts** | Refreshner uses `OscillatorNode` + `GainNode` — works in Chrome MV3 service-worker-controlled tabs. |
| **CSS-only selection override** | MutedHue uses `::selection` + `::-moz-selection` with `!important`. No JavaScript required for basic operation (JS handles adaptive brightness). |
| **WXT build framework (StackLens)** | StackLens uses WXT (Extendable Web Extension Tooling) with React + TypeScript + Tailwind. Unlike other extensions which are vanilla JS, StackLens requires a build step (`wxt build`) to compile the React/TypeScript source into the `.output/chrome-mv3/` directory. |

## 8. Out of Scope (Non-Goals)

- ❌ **No user accounts or authentication** — Extensions work immediately after install with zero sign-up.
- ❌ **No backend server** — Entire site is static HTML. No database, no API, no server-side logic.
- ❌ **No data syncing** — Refreshner state is per-browser, per-tab. No cloud sync of intervals or keywords.
- ❌ **No Safari / Edge specific builds** — Chromium-based browsers only for now (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera). Firefox is on the roadmap (except Goofanizer — requires Chrome-specific debugger API; StackLens — requires Chrome-specific webRequest).
- ❌ **No premium / paid tier** — All extensions are and will remain 100% free and open source.
- ❌ **No A/B testing or analytics on the website** — No tracking scripts, no cookies, no fingerprinting.
